# Business Analytics & Machine Learning

This repository contains the weekly exercises and projects for the **Business Analytics & Machine Learning** course at the Technical University of Munich. The course focuses on the use of machine learning techniques and analytics to solve practical problems in business and economics.

## Course Overview

The course covers the following key areas:
- Numerical prediction
- Classification
- Clustering and dimensionality reduction

- Causal inference

## Week 0: Data IO with Pandas
In this week, we refresh fundamental concepts of data input and output operations using the `pandas` library. The focus is on loading, cleaning, and transforming datasets, which is a crucial step for any data analysis or machine learning task.

### Topics covered:
- Reading data from CSV files using `pandas`
- Exploring the structure of datasets, including attributes (columns), features (datapoints) and basic statistics
- Data aggregation and grouping for calculating summary statistics
- Basic filtering and subsetting of data
- Creating visualizations for data exploration:
  - Histograms for understanding data distribution
  - Scatter plots and line plots for analyzing relationships between variables
  - Box plots for comparing distributions across different categories

You can find the code for this week in the [Week_00](./Week_00/main.py) folder.

Stay tuned for more updates as the course progresses!
